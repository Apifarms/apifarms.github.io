We can install hives in a variety of locations, such as community gardens, orchards, rooftops, backyards and parks.</p>\n<p>Hosting a hive with us a is simple three step process: </p>\n<h3>1. Inspection</h3>\n<p>First, we’ll inspect your location to ensure it provides a favorable environment for the bees. We’ll also start the registration with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>\n<h3>2. Installation</h3>\n<p>Once the optimal bee hive placements are agreed upon, we transport the hives, bees, seeds (if applicable) and equipment to your location. In addition, all honey collected is reflective of the local biodiversity in your neighbourhood - a unique flavour, homegrown.</p>\n<h3>3. Maintenance</h3>\n<p>ApiFarms fully maintains the installed bee hives, with frequent checkups (every ten to fourteen days). We evaluate colony health and growth, prevent contaminations, expand the hive and most deliciously, collect the honey. All of your honey is packaged, labeled and graded.</p>\n<p>We also have a <a href="./seeds">selection of pollinator friendly flower seeds</a> that are available for anybody who wants to help feed the declining population of pollinator insects while planting a beautiful garden in their yard. Please visit the flower seed section if you are interested, we have great extremely low maintenance flowers available for all kinds of pollinators.</p>\n<p>The bee hosting packages we offer start at $450 for a full year.
