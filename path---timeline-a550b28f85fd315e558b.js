We then send a member of the team to come inspect the location to make sure its a healthy location for the hive.  Once everything is confirmed, the rental of the hive begins in late May early Juin. This all depends on the weather we will be having.\nWhen the rental starts, the hive will be in place. We will then care for the bees and maintain regularly or as needed. As the hive grows we will add to it, until it’s time for us to harvest it. Once the product harvested we will give you 70% of the yield. If it happens to be a terrible harvest year no worries,  we will guarantee to supply you with some local honey.\nThen come the time to prepare the hive for winter. Once the hive is ready and packed with food for them to survive the winter, we seal the hive off and come back during the winter to confirm good hive ventilation. The season comes to an end once spring is in the air, we would than come and pick up the hives or continue on if that’s what’s wanted.     </p>",frontmatter:{title:"What a season looks like with us",date:"December 10, 2017"}}},pathContext:{slug:"/timeline/"}}}});
