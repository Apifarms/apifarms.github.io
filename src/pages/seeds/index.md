We offer a line of friendly polinator flowers which allow bees to feed themselves during different periodes of the season.

In addition to helping bees directly, these plants can also improve other areas of the ecosystem, such as  beneficial insects, butterflies, hummingbirds. 

Deer resistant mixes are also available.
