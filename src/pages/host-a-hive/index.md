ApiFarms is all about bringing the beekeeping experience and hive to you. Individuals, families, homeowners, condos, buildings apartments, businesses and schools. We can install hives in lots of different locations such as community gardens, orchards, rooftops, backyards and parks. ApiFarms does its best to select docile honey bees, so no need to worry!


Once we install your hive, we immediately ensure that all local city bylaws are met before proceeding. The hives are registered with Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA). We offer fully managed hive rentals and we do all the work, and strive to ensure you can be involved in the process as little or as much as you want.


Enjoy all the benefits of the hive, while learning about it and at the end at harvest season enjoy honey from your own backyard! In addition, bee hives are deterrents to wasps. (Include link) They do so because they occupy a certain territory. Please [contact us](./contact) if you have any questions or if you would like to book your hives now (link to contact page?).

## Thinking of getting a hive with us? 


Thinking of getting a hive with us? Below are some of the steps we would go through in a year.


The first step is to send us an inquiry via telephone or email, with information regarding where you would like the hive to be placed. We will send a member of the team to inspect the location to ensure it is a healthy location for the hive. Once everything is confirmed, the rental of the hive begins in late May and early June. The start date of the rental hive is all weather dependentas bees rely on sunny days for foraging.


When the rental starts, the hive will be in place. The hives will come already registered with OMAFRA.We will then care for the bees, inspecting and maintaining regularly and as needed. As the hive grows we expand the hive by adding supers, or until it’s time for us to harvest your honey. Once harvested, wegive back to the community 70% of the yield. If it happens to be a terrible harvest year no worries; we will guarantee to supply you with some local honey.


Then comes the time to prepare the hive for winter. Once the hive is ready and packed with food for them to survive the winter, the inspecting apiarist will seal the hive and come back during the winter months to confirm good hive ventilation. The season comes to an end once spring is back in the air, we would then performing our spring inspection. 


For ApiFarms to well maintain a hive customers can expect to see us twice or more on a monthly basis, but no worries since we can tend to the hives even if you are gone on a trip.
