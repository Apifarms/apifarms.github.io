Patrick Joubarne takes care of maintaining the hives and likes to keep up with modern bee technology. Peter Stolarski helps with the maintenance of hives and is always thinking of new ways to enhance our phytosanitary practices.

When he's not developing sustainable agricultural practices in the industrial hemp industry, he's still enjoying nature through his hobby of bee keeping. His infectious passion for his hobby has organically grown into ApiFarms.



### Peter Stolarski
  
Imagine a community that relies on another thriving community – that’s humanity with bees. The apparent changes to the apicultural environment and its impact on biodiversity observed across the last half century is staggering – and it is only the beginning if greater efforts are not made to improve the wellness of our buzzing fellows.

### Patrick Joubarne

Bees are a magnificent creature, from the complexity and simplicity of their anatomy to their beauty. Their ability to work organize and plan make for a very intelligent species. A colony's productivity provides a connecting pattern to nature. With out their wholesome hard work, the world would see no future. They're gentle majestic pollinators that nature has provided us naturally. Humanity has made it its own responsibility to keep a balance in this ecosystem.
