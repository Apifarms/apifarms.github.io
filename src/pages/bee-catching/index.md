We offer swarm extraction.

What is swarming? 

Swarming is the process in which a new honey bee colony is formed from an existing colony due to limited space and/or unfavorable circumstances, in which the colony flees to a more preferable shelter. Sometimes, the most convenient shelter for a honey bee colony is not necessarily the most convenient for people. We are available for swarm capture and transport, ensuring they are re-located to our apiary. 

If you happen to come by a bee swarm please [contact us](/contact) as soon as possible.
