## Welcome to Api Farm!

Our mission is to combat the declining bee population and pollinator insects while taking an Holistic approach to urban and rural agricultural methods. By educating the public while maintaining multiple rural and urban hives near our areas we hope to help the rise of bees and pollinator insects and contribute to the development of local urban and rural agriculture by installing hives and wildflower seed mixes.  Customers who chose our host a hive services will receive a fully installed, continuously maintained hive for a full year and up to 70% of the honey harvest.
