## Welcome to Api Farm!

Our mission is to combat the declining population of pollinator insects while taking a hollistic approach to urban and rural agriculture methods. By doing our best to educate the public while maintaining multiple rural and urban hives near our areas, we hope to help the rise of pollinators and contribute to the development of local urban and rural agriculture.
