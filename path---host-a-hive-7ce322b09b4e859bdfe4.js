Individuals, families, homeowners, condos, buildings apartments, businesses and schools.  We can install hives in lots of different locations  such as community gardens, orchards, rooftops, backyards and parks. Honey bees are  friendly bees…… </p>\n<p>Once we are contacted to install a hive we immediately ensure that all local city bylaws are meet before proceeding. The hives are registered with OMAFRA.  We offer fully managed hive rentals. We do all the work and include you in the process as little or as much as you want.</p>\n<p>Enjoy all the benefits of the hive, while learning about it and at the end at harvest season enjoy honey from your own backyard!

Please contact us for more information.</p>\n<h2>Thinking of getting a hive with us?</h2>\n<p>Well here are some of the steps we would go thru in a year. </p>\n<p>The first step is to send us an inquiry, with information regarding where you would like the hive to be placed. We will send a member of the team to inspect the location to make sure its a healthy location for the hive.  Once everything is confirmed, the rental of the hive begins in late May early June.  …….. This all depends on the weather we will be having since beekeeping is dependent on good weather..</p>\n<p>When the rental starts, the hive will be in place. The hives will come already registered with OMAFRA (Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs).We will then care for the bees and maintain regularly and  as needed. As the hive grows we will add to it, until it’s time for us to harvest it. Once the product harvested we will give you 70% of the yield. If it happens to be a terrible harvest year no worries,  we will guarantee to supply you with some local honey. </p>\n<p>Then come the time to prepare the hive for winter. Once the hive is ready and packed with food for them to survive the winter, we seal the hive off and come back during the winter to confirm good hive ventilation. The season comes to an end once spring is back in the air, we would then come and pick up the hives or continue on if that’s what’s wanted.  </p>\n<p>For ApiFarms to well maintain a hive customers can expect to see us twice or more on a monthly basis, but no worries since we can tend to the hives even if you are gone on a trip.    </p>\n<p>Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions. </p>",frontmatter:{title:"Host a hive",date:"December 10, 2017",exclude_hr:null,exclude:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/host-a-hive/"}}}});
