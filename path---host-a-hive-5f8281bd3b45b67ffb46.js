Individuals, families, homeowners, condos, buildings apartments, businesses we can put the hives in lots of different promising areas.\nWe also have a selection of pollinator friendly flower seeds available for anybody who wants to help feed the declining population of pollinator insects. We have enough seeds that we could plant a whole field!  Please visite the flower seed section if you are interested, we have great extremely low maintenance flowers available.</p>\n<p>When you contact us to install a hive at your location we immediatly check in what municipality you are located in and the regulations    </p>\n<h2>What will my year look like?</h2>\n<p>The first step is to send us an inquiry, with information regarding where you would like the hive to be placed. We then send a member of the team to come inspect the location to make sure its a healthy location for the hive.  Once everything is confirmed, the rental of the hive begins in late May early Juin. This all depends on the weather we will be having.\nWhen the rental starts, the hive will be in place. We will then care for the bees and maintain regularly or as needed. As the hive grows we will add to it, until it’s time for us to harvest it. Once the product harvested we will give you 70% of the yield. If it happens to be a terrible harvest year no worries,  we will guarantee to supply you with some local honey.\nThen come the time to prepare the hive for winter. Once the hive is ready and packed with food for them to survive the winter, we seal the hive off and come back during the winter to confirm good hive ventilation. The season comes to an end once spring is in the air, we would than come and pick up the hives or continue on if that’s what’s wanted.     </p>",frontmatter:{title:"Host a hive",date:"December 10, 2017",exclude_hr:null,exclude:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/host-a-hive/"}}}});
