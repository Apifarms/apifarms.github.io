Patrick Joubarne takes care of maintaining the hives and likes to keep up with modern bee technology. Peter Stolarski helps with the maintenance of hives and is always thinking of new ways to enhance our phytosanitary practices.   </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Jean-Guy Vaillancourt</h3>\n<p>Jean-Guy Vaillancourt is a professional agricultural technician who specializes in organic agriculture. When he’s not developing sustainable agricultural practices in the industrial hemp industry, he’s still enjoying nature through his hobby of bee keeping. His infectious passion for his hobby has organically grown into ApiFarms.</p>\n<h3>Peter Stolarski</h3>\n<p>Life moves fast and sometimes we get distracted by the little things. Although sometimes, it’s the little things that can make all the difference, and with some directive attention we can truly grasp the bigger picture. Imagine a thriving community that relies on another thriving community – that’s humanity with bees. The apparent changes to our api-biotic environment observed across the turn of the century is staggering – and it is only the beginning if things do not improve for the wellness of our buzzing fellows. If there’s one thing that drives us towards helping the community, its recognizing that honey is thicker than blood.</p>\n<h3>Patrick Joubarne</h3>\n<p>Bees are a magnificent creature, from the complexity and simplicity of their anatomy to their beauty. Their ability to work organize and plan make for a very intelligent species. A colony’s productivity provides a connecting pattern to nature. Unleashing a humble sense of being in all of us. With out their wholesome hard work, the world would see no future. The humble honey bee keeps the flowing stream of everlasting life on earth. They’re gentle majestic pollinators that nature has provided us naturally. Humanity has made it its own responsibility to keep a balance in this ecosystem.</p>",frontmatter:{title:"About us",date:"December 10, 2017",exclude_hr:null,exclude:null,image:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/about/"}}}});
